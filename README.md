# m3b management system
This app is for now intended to be a personal project showcasing some web development skills as part of my portfolio.

It's a CRUD app using :
 - NextJS Meta framework
    - based on ReactJS 
- Coded in TypeScript
- Connected to a MongoDB Database. 

It's still under progress, as many features could be added.
It has the potential to be a dedicated end-to-end solution for this type of industry.

## Deployment
---
This app will be deployed thanks to the vercel platform, clicking on this link: 
[https://m3b-mgtm-service.vercel.app/](https://m3b-mgtm-service.vercel.app/)

## Installation
---
To run this app locally, you would need to clone the project then run those commands:

> `npm install`
-  To install the dependancies 


> `npm run dev`
- Then run the project


The project will run on `localhost:3000/`

However, currently, you would not have access to the database's data. Using the deployment link, you'll be able to interact with the database. We recommend usign the deployed link for now.

## Current Features
---
- Create and manage products and inventory (beers only for now) - create, edit, read and delete
    - Display of database data in tables, with sorted options
    - Manipulate data dynamically
    - Routing and redirection

## Potential Features To Add or In Progress
